Dusangire Lunch – Backend

The Dusangire Lunch Backend is a secure, RESTful API built with Django and Django REST Framework, serving as the core engine for managing contributions, distributions, and school data related to the Rwandan school feeding program.

It supports:

Admin and superuser role-based access

Data upload and management via API

PDF and Excel report generation

Secure user authentication

Soft deletion workflows with approval logic

Built with powerful technologies:

Django

Django REST Framework

PostgreSQL

Django CORS Headers

ReportLab & Pandas (for reporting)
